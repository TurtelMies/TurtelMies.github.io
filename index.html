  <div id="about"></div>
  
    <p>My name is Jesse Timonen. I am a 16 year old guy from Finland. I am really interested in programming. The programming languages I use are C#, HTML and CSS. Also I know Java script slightly. I have used Scratch before, but not anymore. </p>
    <p>I am good at jobs that require teamwork. I like working with someone as a pair or a group rather than being alone. I also have a great sence of humour.</p>

    <p>I have graduated from elementary school (Grades 1-9) in 2022. Currently I am in vocational shcool, Osao Kaukovainio, studying programming and computers.
